			Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament<br/>
			And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br/>
			Within thine own bud buriest thy content<br/>

			Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,<br/>

			If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br/>

			Proving his beauty by succession thine!<br/>
